\frametitle{Summary}
\label{sec-8}

  In this tutorial, we have learnt to -

\begin{itemize}
\item Declare a sequence of numbers using the function ``array''.
\item Perform element wise squaring using the ``square'' function.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Summary contd..}
\label{sec-8.1}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use the various options available for plotting like dots, lines.
\item Plot experimental data such that we can also represent error by using the \texttt{errorbar()} function.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\frametitle{Evaluation}
\label{sec-9}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Square the following sequence.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item distance\_values=[2.1, 4.6, 8.72, 9.03]\pause
	\end{itemize}
\vspace{8pt}
\item Plot L v/s T in red plusses from the Simple Pendulum Data.
\end{enumerate}
