Hello friends.

This tutorial is a self-assessment tutorial and you will be able to assess 
yourself on the concepts learnt in the Module "Plotting Expetimental data"

As with all other assessments we will first start with a few short questions 
that will not take you more that 15 to 20 seconds to answer. Then we shall move
on to a bigger problems that should take you about 5 mins.

{{{ Always show slide and explain the problem }}} 

 * What is the shape of plot resulting from the following piece of code::

       x = linspace(0, 2*pi, 4)
       plot(x, sin(x))

 * #[Nishanth]: Hav to add a simple question on scatter plot

 * #[Nishanth]: Hav to add a simple question on pie chart

 * Input file contains 25 lines of data, each containing 5 values seperated by
   spaces. What is the shape of the resulting matrix from the command::

       loadtxt("input-file.txt", unpack=True)

{{{ Big problem - 5 mins }}} 

The input file ``pos.txt`` contains two columns of data. The first column 
contains x position and second column contains y position of a particle in
flight. Plot the trajectory of the particle. What kind of motion is it?
