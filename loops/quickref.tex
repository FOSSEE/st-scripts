\textbf{loops}

To iterate over a sequence: \lstinline|for i in sequence:|\\
\texttt{i} is the looping variable. 

To iterate while a condition is true: \lstinline|while condition:|

Blocks in python are indented. To end block return to the previous
indentation. 

To break out of the innermost loop: \lstinline|break|

To skip to end of current iteration: \lstinline|continue|

\lstinline|pass| is just a syntactic filler.
