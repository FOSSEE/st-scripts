* Objectives
  At the end of this tutorial you will be able to
  - draw multiple plots which are overlaid
  - use the figure command
  - use the legend command 
  - switch between the plots and perform some operations on each of them like
    saving the plots.
  - create and switch between subplots

* Question1
  - Draw two plots overlaid upon each other, with the first plot
    being a parabola of the form y = 4(x ^ 2) and the second being a
    straight line of the form y = 2x + 3 in the interval -5 to 5.
  - Use colors to differentiate between the plots and use legends to
    indicate what each plot is doing.
* Question2
  - Draw a line of the form y = x as one figure and another line
    of the form y = 2x + 3.
  - Switch back to the first figure, annotate the x and y intercepts.
  - Now switch to the second figure and annotate its x and y intercepts.
    Save each of them.
* Question3
  - We know that the Pressure, Volume and Temperatures are held by
    the equation PV = nRT where nR is a constant. Let us assume
    nR=0.01 Joules/Kelvin and T = 200K.
    V can be in the range from 21cc to 100cc.
  - Draw two different plots as subplots, one being the Pressure
    versus Volume plot and the other being Pressure versus Temperature
    plot.
* Summary
  In this tutorial, we have learnt to â€“
  - draw multiple plots which are overlaid.
  - use the figure command.
  - use the legend command.
  - switch between the plots and perform some operations on each
    of them like saving the plots.
  - create subplots and to switch between them.
