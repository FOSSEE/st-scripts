\frametitle{Objectives}
\label{sec-2}
In this tutorial, we will learn - \pause
\begin{itemize}
\item create and switch between subplots
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{System Specifications}\pause
\begin{itemize}
\item Ubuntu Linux 14.04\pause
\item \texttt{Python 2.7.6} \pause

\frametitle{Pre-requisites}
\label{sec-3}
To practise this tutorial, you should know how to 
\begin{itemize}
\item run basic Python commands on the ipython console
\item use Plots interactively.
\item Embellish a plot.
\end{itemize}
If not, see the pre-requisite Python tutorials on {\color{blue}http://spoken-tutorial.org}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Exercise 1}
\label{sec-6}
\begin{itemize}
\item We know that the Pressure, Volume and Temperatures are held by the equation PV=nRT where nR is a constant. Let us assume nR=0.01 J/K and T=200K.V can be in the range from 21cc to 100cc.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Exercise 1}
\label{sec-6}
\begin{itemize}
\item  Draw two different plots as subplots, one being the P vs V plot and the other being P vs T plot.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
