\label{sec-3}
\begin{itemize}
\item Read the file ``pendulum\_semicolon.txt'' which contains the same data as ``pendulum.txt'', but the columns are separated by semi-colons instead of spaces.\pause
\item Use the \texttt{ipython} help to see how to do this.

\frametitle{Summary}
\label{sec-4}

  In this tutorial, we have learnt to - 

\begin{itemize}
\item Read data from files, containing a single column of data using the
    \texttt{loadtxt} command.
\item Read multiple columns of data, separated by spaces or other
    delimiters by adding additional arguments to the \texttt{loadtxt} command.
\end{itemize}
